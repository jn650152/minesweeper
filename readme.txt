1.Functionalities:

It allows users to 
(1)play minesweeper game(timer, counting unrevealed mines, auto-reveal the surrounding cells if the clicked one indicates no mine around,flagging, canceling a flag, providing hints, reset, simple error check,Dialogues showing results, etc.), 

(2)change setting according to preference(background sound, volume, different levels, hints number and background picture),

(3)share the app to friends,

(4)check top 10 game records(rankings based on different levels),

(5)check help documents.

2.Notes:
(1)To get the best user experience, this app is better to be run on Nextus 5 with API 26.

(2)You can run it directly on a simulator.
You may come across the problem "Session 'app' error while installing APK." If so, you can resolve the error by unchecking the instant run ( Android Studio > Preferences > Build,Execution,Deployment > Instant Run)

(3)All the pictures and sound are from Google.
I also have used a third-party library to draw an animated circle menu.
